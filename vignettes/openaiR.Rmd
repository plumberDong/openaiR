# Prerequisites

You need an OpenAI API key obtained from OpenAI **OR** an API key and endpoint provided by another intermediary platform.

```
#--------------
# OpenAI API key
#--------------
#api_key <-  "sk-xxxxx"

#-------------------------
# API key and endpoint
#-------------------------
#api_key <- "sk-xxxxx"
#api_base_url2 <- "https://api.xxx.xxx/v1"
```

# Completions

The prompt can be a single text:

```
x <- get_completions("I love you!", 
                     api_key = api_key, 
                     api_base_url = api_base_url) # if your OpenAI API key is obtained from OpenAI, just leave api_base_url parameter default
str(x)
```

The prompt can also be a list:

```
prompt = list(
  list(
    role = "system",
    content = "You are a poetic assistant, skilled in explaining complex programming concepts with creative flair."
  ),
  list(
    role = "user",
    content = "Compose a poem that explains the concept of recursion in programming."
  )
)

x <- get_completions(prompt, 
                     api_key = api_key, 
                     api_base_url = api_base_url)
str(x)
```

The response is a list with a complex structure, but sometimes we may only need the message it returns. We can use `extract_info` to simplify the received response:

```
extract_info(x)
```


# Embeddings

The input_text should be a single text:

```
x <- get_embeddings(input_text = "I LOVE YOU, openaiR！",
                    api_key = api_key,
                    api_base_url = api_base_url)
str(x)
```

If we only need the embeddings it returns, we can use `extract_info` to simplify it:

```
res <- extract_info(x)
str(res)
```

As we can see, the default model "text-embedding-3-large" returns a vector with 3072 dimensions! Storing or analyzing such a long vector can be challenging, especially when dealing with many pieces of text. In certain cases, you may need to change the embedding dimensions after generating them.

According to [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/use-cases), the new embedding models were trained with a technique that allows developers to shorten embeddings without losing their concept-representing properties. The openaiR package adopts their methods and integrates the whole process into the `prune_embeddings` function:

```
prune_res <- prune_embeddings(embeddings = res, 
                              #n dim: the number of dimensions you wanted.
                              ndim = 256)
str(prune_res)
